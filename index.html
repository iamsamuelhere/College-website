                The Department of Computer Science and Engineering came into existence with the establishment of the institution East Point College of Engineering And Technology (EPCET) in the year 1999, affiliated to Visveswaraya Technological University (VTU), Belgaum, Karnataka, with the aim to impart state of the art technical education and to carry out cutting edge research. The programmes currently offered by the Department are Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.- four years) with intake of 120 and Master of Technology (M.Tech. â€“ two years) in Computer Science and Engineering and in Software Engineering, each with an intake of 18.<br>
                <br>

The department serves to create a centre of excellence for budding professionals so as to equip them with strong fundamental concepts, programming and problem solving skills with an exposure to emerging technologies by providing hands-on experience.

The courses offered deal with both theoretical and practical aspects of the theoretical foundations of computation and information processing, design and understanding of concepts behind computational processes and programming languages from the basic level to the application level to meet industry requirements in the rapidly changing environment. A student undergoes courses in programming languages, object oriented concepts, algorithms, operating systems, system software, compiler design, database management system, computer networks, computer graphics, web design, cryptography, computer architecture, artificial intelligence, etc. Hence, on completion of the course, a student can analyze, design, develop, test and optimize solutions in C, C++, Java, Python and .NET platforms and can contribute as software developers, hardware engineers, system analysts, database analysts, security analysts, software testers, software quality assurance engineers, etc. The department has V.T.U recognized research centre, started in the year 2007. Five candidates have been awarded Ph.D. degree through this research centre. Currently we have ten faculties pursuing their Ph.D. More than sixty papers have been published in national and international journals.

The Department has well equipped networked computer laboratories with Wi-Fi providing unlimited Internet access. This offers good practical knowledge as per the academic requirements. A well equipped research lab has been setup with funds from VTU-VGST. Research activities in the areas of Computer Networks, Cloud Computing, Image processing, Data Mining, and Software Engineering are being carried out by research scholars. A separate library with a good collection of latest books is also available. The students of CSE have secured admissions to prestigious universities in India and abroad. They have performed excellently well in campus placements and are working in leading IT industries, such as ORACLE India Pvt. Ltd., Infosys, LG Soft India, Accenture, Fujitec India Pvt. Ltd., Sonata Software Ltd., Reliance Jio, Dell India Ltd.

The dedicated team of faculty members are highly qualified and engaged in quality teaching, research and training programs. Their passion for teaching drives the department in nurturing the students to excellence. They are also actively involved in research and together have published several articles in national and international journals and conferences. They enrich their knowledge by attending various Faculty Development Programs, seminars, conferences and workshops at national and international levels.
